# Version Control with Git + CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Outline

This workshop will cover the essentials of Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions. The
content is tailored to domain scientists wanting to work collaboratively on code
and add automation to certain parts of their workflows. Topics covered include
version control basics with Git, hosting a repository on GitHub, working
collaboratively with others, and using GitHub Actions for automation and
continuous integration / continuous deployment. Hands-on participation is
encouraged. Attendees will benefit the most if they are prepared with a laptop
and access to the Git CLI, a GitHub account, and a Docker Hub account.
